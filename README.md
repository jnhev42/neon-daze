# Neon Daze
A school project game made in Rust with the Bevy engine over a few months. It's rouge-like twin stick shooter with *minimalist* graphics (i.e. all boxes).
Exists mostly in the proof-of-concept state as I don't want to work on it anymore.

# Build Instructions
- Native:
`cargo make build-native`
- WASM:
`cargo make build-web` (and use `index.html` to load the `.js` (with the `.wasm` in the same directory))
